# BrainwaveAI ðŸ§ 
I created this bot mainly for myself and colleges to use ChatGPT even when it's down (what happens quite oftenðŸ™ˆ).
First I just implemented an ask-feature based on davinci but later switch to GPT-3.5-turbo because I wanted to implement a feature where you can
ask specific coding related questions. For that I needed the bot to remember previous messages and safe the conversation. 
Later in the project I also added image generation because I just wanted to play a little bit with the OpenAI APIðŸ˜„

I also learned how to deploy something like a bot and to keep it running 24/7. It's hosted via DigitalOcean and Bitvise.

I plan on improving the bot and to publish it someday.
